## Additional Documentation

In case of the team comes up with multiple solutions to the problem statement, irrespective of the implementation please document the same on a high level and upload the supporting documents (if any) in this section.

In addition to applying collaborative and content- based filtering on user data to survey user behaviour, we also wish to implement a smart chat bot to further personalize recvommendations for a user. We also intend to use the feedback and suggestions obtained by scraping Dell complaint portals and social media accounts to provide the company with better insights for designing support products. When a user writes an issue in the feedback portal, relevant words are extracted from it, and if those words are mapped to an existing service, that service is recommended to the user.
